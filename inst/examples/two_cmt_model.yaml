  This is a simple pk model; going to demonstrate how we can specify reactions
  as fluxes and put them together as reactions.

init: {
  gut: {value: 0, unit: mg, label: amount in the gut compartment},
  cent: {value: 0, unit: mg, label: amount in the central compartment},
  periph: 0
}

param: { ka: 1.2, cl: 1, v1: 10, v2: 40, q: 5}

main: |
  double k10 = cl/v1;
  double k12 = q/v1;
  double k21 = q/v2;
ode_assignments: |
  double conc = cent/v1;
reactions:
  - label: absorption from depot compartment
    species: gut --> cent
    form: ka * gut
  - label: elimination from central compartment
    species: cent --> NULL
    form: cl * conc
  - label: distribution between central & peripheral compartment
    species: cent <--> periph
    form: k12 * cent - k21 * periph
table: |
  capture cp = cent/v1;
capture:
  - k10
